/**
 * We use two connectors to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The first one is
 * what it's called an injected web3 provider which, by default, is MetaMask. In
 * case the user doesn't have MetaMask installed, we'll fallback to the Infura URL
 * as the connector. The term injected means code or data that comes from a user's
 * browser and is available for the website to use. By using Infura we can perform
 * calls to the Ethereum blockchain (for instance getting some public variable's
 * value) but we cannot sign any transactions.
